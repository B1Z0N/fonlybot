  <b>Fonly</b>👋 allows you to upload a doc to google drive and get a link to it. 
  It comes in handy when you don't have any docx editor installed: you can work with it online.
  
  <b>Main workflow</b>:
  
  Authorize with /google(only first time), give me any file and get your link. That simple.

authorized_html: Currently you are <b>authorized</b> 🟢.
not_authorized_html: Currently you are <b>not authorized</b> 🔴(press /google to use me).

language: Please, select the language.
language_selected_html: <b>Fonly</b> speaks English now.

google_signin_md: Signin [here]({0}) and paste the code below, so I could take care of everything else. 
google_success: Successfully signed in. Try giving me some files.
google_failure: Oops, something wrong with your code, try again.

upload_success_md: You've successfully uploaded ["{0}"]({1}).
upload_failure_md: Failure on "{0}"" upload, try again.

authorize_first_md: Authorize with /google before sending any docs.
